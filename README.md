# Nocket
Secure lightweight NodeJS Websocket module with no dependencies.

This project is purely designed to be a learning experience for me. There are other very great libraries
for NodeJS that facilitate WebSockets. One of the goals of this project is to only use built in node features,
implementing the WebSocket protocol myself from the official specification.

It is not yet complete, but very functional for normal purposes. Currently I've
only used it for my discord bot module nord, so if that project doesn't require it, then it's probably
not in here. I will definitely expand and adapt and probably rewrite this in the future.
